Right now I have tried use a dummy fundamental trader (the one used in the other_bots). 
In that case, its profit is around 5,000 with a 30k standard deviation.
You can uncomment the fundamental trader in my_bot and comment the bot we wrote to run a santity test.
Yet, the bot we implemented managed to get a little more profit than the fundamental trader 
while having a much smaller std of 7,000.

The problem we have right now is that if we have only 1 fundamental & 10 technical traders,
our bot was outperformed by the fundamental (almost 50 times) as it was heavily influenced by technical traders (noises)
However, if we have 10 fundamental & 1 technical traders,
our bot outperformed the fundamental by gaining twice as much profit and a much lower std deviation.



#Update 0.0
Currently, I am able to earn profit with a relatively low standard deviation. 
The problem is that the proportion of tech traders and fundamental traders has a great effect on the bot performance.
Take a look at the my_bot.py. The code is heavily commented. Feel free to change.





You should only need to modify my_bot.py. A rather silly example bot
is provided.

To run the simulation:
  python my_bot.py

You can choose between plotting a single simulation and printing
aggregate statistics for multiple simulations by
commenting/uncommenting the appropriate lines in main().

Required Python packages:
  numpy
  matplotlib

In general, the line:

bots.extend(other_bots.get_bots(num_fundamentals, num_technical))

...will create a simulation with 1 + num_fundamentals + num_technical
traders including your bot. You can include multiple copies of your
bot or other bots in the simulation by adding them to the list with
bots.append (for a single bot) or bots.extend (for a list of bots).

other_bots.py includes one type of fundamentals trader and two types
of technical traders (get_bots() splits num_technical evenly between
these two types). The technical traders use the price history only,
and do not make money on average: they simulate noise traders which we
often see in real markets.
